# Milestones-App
An R app using the shiny library made to track a group of incoming students (referred to as a cohort) across a certain period of time to
track their academic milestones. I think overall the best takeway from this is the layout and plotly. It is very hard to comb through the
plotly documentation and look for forums on stackoverflow on how to manipulate plotly. So I am saving you all the trouble, this code will
essentially tell you how to alter the colors of a bar graph. From a shiny perspective there was nothing fancy, the real work was filtering 
the data with a fine tooth comb. Bellow is a screenshot of the actual app.

<strong><i>Note: the code is up but will not run on R studio because it needs immediate access to a server for the school I work for.
For security resons, this server is not accessible. A link to the app will be posted soon...</i></strong>
